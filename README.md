GUI Builder for OpenSGToolbox
=============================

About
-----

This is a Graphical User Interface(GUI) builder for the OpenSGToolbox libraries. It
can be used to construct a GUI by creating GUI components in a visual editor,
arranging them, changing their properties, saving to a file, and loading saved
files.

This GUI Builder is similar to
[Interface Builder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Builder "Interface Builder")
on OS X and the [NetBeans IDE](http://netbeans.org/ "NetBeans IDE") for Java Swing.
